# Ezlo's custom Home Assistant addons

This repository defines a few custom addons for Home Assistant. Notably:

- [PostgreSQL](./postgres): provides a PostgreSQL instance, strongly inspired by the [official MariaDB](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/tree/master/mariadb) addon.
- [Kresus](./kresus): sets-up a [Kresus](https://kresus.org/) instance which is a personal finances management software.

These addons are published under [MIT license](./LICENSE).
